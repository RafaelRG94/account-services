# account-services

### Arquitecture

The architecture pattern I have used for this solution is the MVC. For this service we will have only two domains, accounts and transactions. The following is a description of the decisions taken during the development

### Run the service

To launch the application, simply navigate to the root directory of the project and run:

```mvn spring-boot:run```

The project configuration is the default configuration, so the service is exposed on localhost:8080
